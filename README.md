# Decentralized_Data_Sharing
## Introduction :
This project aims to create a decentralized system for storing and sharing health data. By using blockchain technology, we can ensure that data is secure and can only be accessed by authorized parties. This technology can be integrated with any smart city website (Here we have integrated it with our smart city website through a admin and user login page).

## Technical details
The system will be built using the Ethereum blockchain, and data will be stored on IPFS. Users will be able to connect to the system using a web3-enabled browser, such as MetaMask. Data will be encrypted and stored in a decentralized manner, with only authorized parties having access to the decryption keys.

## Features 
-Data encryption

-Data sharing with authorized parties

-Data access through web3-enabled browser

-Data immutability through blockchain technology

## Future developments
-Integration with existing health systems

-AI-based data analysis

-Providing incentives for users who contribute data

-Adding more data types and fields
